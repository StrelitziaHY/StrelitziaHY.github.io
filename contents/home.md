#### Education
2025.09 - present, visiting PhD student at Gran Sasso Science Institute, Italy

2022.08 - present, Astrophysics, Department of Astronomy & Kavli Institute for Astronomy and Astrophysics, Peking University.

2018.08 - 2022.06, Astronomy, School of Physics, Peking University.

#### Research Interests
I have broad interests in gravitational-wave astrophysics, including gravity theory, multi-messenger astronomy, data-analysis methods, and instrumentation.

I am currently working on the detection of gravitational waves using lunar seismology. Our goal is to develop a comprehensive understanding of this promising detection technique: from basic response theory and detector/source analysis to potential applications in geophysics.
