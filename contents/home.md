#### Education
2025.09 - present, visiting PhD student at Gran Sasso Science Institute, Italy

2022.08 - present, Astrophysics, Department of Astronomy & Kavli Institute for Astronomy and Astrophysics, Peking University.

2018.08 - 2022.06, Astronomy, School of Physics, Peking University.

#### Research Interests
I have a wide interest in Gravitational-waves astrophysics: including gravity theory, multi-messenger-source, data analysis techniques, and instrument techniques.

Currently I am working on lunar seismic gravitational wave detection. We hope to have a comprehensive understanding of this amazing detection technique, from basic response theory to detector/source analysis, and even including its geophysics applications.
